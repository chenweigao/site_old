This is a basic note about Linux shell, I have wrote plenty of bash shell,  which helps solve problem easily.

# 1. System Operation

## System Information

Sometimes, you may want to see the system kernel version, 2 ways are available :

```shell
lsb_release -a
cat /etc/issue
```

change password for a user:

```shell
sudo passwd root
```

## SSH

```shell
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
#ssh config
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

start server:

```shell
sudo service ssh restart/start
```

A bug:

```shell
sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
```



# 2. Add Choice for User

`read -p` is very useful for  this, for example:

```shell
read -n1 -p "What is your system version? 
1: Ubuntu 16.04;
2: Ubuntu 17.10;
3: Ubuntu 18.04;
choose a number between 1, 2 and 3: " answer
case $answer in
1) ...;;
2) ...;;
3) ...;;
esac
```

*Tips* :

- `-n1` : -n and 1 are used together, which means `read` commmand will quit when system accept a single character, no need for Enter.
- `-s` : this options will avoid displaying user *passwords* on the screen.
- `-t 5`: overtime option, this means that user must complete the input within 5 seconds.

# 3. Shell Array

```shell
arrayName=(array_content)
#get the content of arrary, or [*]
echo ${arraryName[@]}
#get the size of array
echo ${#arrayName[*]}
```

# 4. Sed

```shell
current_plugins_version=$(dpkg -s picoscenes-plugins-demo-rxsbroadcaster-chronos | grep Version | sed 's/Version: //g')
```

This is a basic use of sed, `sed 's/Version: //g'` means that a select : 

``` shell
Version: 18.0406.2333
```

Output is:

``` shell
18.0406.2333
```

That means **replace** "Version:  " with **empty**.

## tr

`tr` 可以理解为`sed`的简化版本

Usage: `tr [OPTION]... SET1 SET2`

- -c, -C, --complement: use the complement of SET1(不常用)

- -d, -delete: delete characters in SET1

-  -s: replace each sequence of a repeated character, 删除所有重复出现字符序列，只保留第一个

  ```shell
  #将所有的the替换为my
  tr -s 'the' 'my'
  tr -s ' ' '\n'
  
  #删除所有的the
  tr -d 'the'
  
  #小写变大写
  tr [a-z] [A-Z]
  
  #删除连续的重复字母
  tr -s [a-zA-Z]
  ```
