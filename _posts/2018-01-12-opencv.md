OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. 
Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

## CV2 operation

To use the camera to find the frame face

```python
video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
process_this_frame = True
while True:
    # Grab a single frame of video
    ret, frame = video_capture.read()

    # Resize frame of video to 1/4 size for faster face recognition processing
    small_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (0, 0), fx=0.25, fy=0.25)

    # Convert the image from BGR color (which OpenCV uses) to RGB color (which face_recognition uses)
    rgb_small_frame = small_frame[:, :, ::-1]

    # Only process every other frame of video to save time
    if process_this_frame:
        # Find all the faces and face encodings in the current frame of video
        f_face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(rgb_small_frame)
        f_face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(
            rgb_small_frame, f_face_locations)
        # print(f_face_encodings)
        for f_face_encoding in f_face_encodings:
            match = face_recognition.compare_faces(face_encodings, f_face_encoding, 0.4)
            print(match)
            for (i, name) in enumerate(face_correct_names):
                if match[i]:
                    print(face_correct_names[i])
    process_this_frame = not process_this_frame
    cv2.imshow('Video2', frame)
    # Hit 'q' on the keyboard to quit!
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

video_capture.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
