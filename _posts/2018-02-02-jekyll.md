Do you want to build your own site from scratch or generate one for your project? This guide could help you with **Jekyll** and **GitHub Pages**.

## GitHub Pages

Before we start build our Jekyll site, we should do as follows in GitHub:

- Create a new **empty** repository, **name** is *username*.github.io; For example, my repository named chenweigao.github.io.
- In your home folder, clone this repository, using `git clone`
- If you have any questions about **Git** ,see my another post [Git - To Use Git More Easily: Config, Branch and Rebase](https://chenweigao.github.io/2018/01/12/git.html)

## Jekyll

### Install

Take Ubuntu system as an example:

```shell
# Install 
sudo apt-get install ruby jekyll
```

### Build Site

```shell
# After you install jekyll
jekyll new ~/username.github.io/
```

After you do this, you will see a directory `blog`, then:

```
cd username.github.io
jekyll server
```

Then your site could be seen at: `http://localhost:4000`, open your browser and type it, you'll see your new site.

### Blog Directory Structure

If you `ls` in your *blog* directory, you will see many files, a overview of what will be used for you does:

**_config.yml**:  your configuration data

In this file, your could do many things to your site, this is my _confg.yml file, you can edit as soon as you like.

```ruby
#_config.yml
title: Nerche Note
email: weigao1024@foxmail.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Welcom to my profile pages!
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
github_username:  chenweigao
```


**_posts**:  this is where your article stored, when you want to publish a new blog, to **CREATE** a new file here, the naming convention of these files is important, and must follow the format:`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`,such as: `2018-02-02-myblog.md`, please remember this, it is very **important**. 

### Add Post

We create a new markdown file named `2018-02-02-test.md`:

```html
---
layout: post
title:  "This is a test blog"
tags:
  - blog
modify_date: 2017-01-01
---
## You will see me at [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000)
The head is **required** in every posts
which tells system you post's title, layout, time and so on...
```

Then you need to open your `terminal`, and type: 

```shell
jekyll build
jekyll server
```

Then you open your browser, and type `https://localhost:4000` , your will find the blog's update.

### Publish Blog

Now it is time to publish your blog in GitHub Pages, you need to:

{% highlight shell %}
# in your blog folder
git add .
git commit -m "my frist blog"
git push
{% endhighlight %}

The you can see your blog at *username*.github.io, such as [chenweigao.github.io](chenweigao.github.io)

### Highlight Code

Sometimes, especially for a coder, you may want to highlight your code:

{% highlight c %}

int mian(){
  printf("Hello Jekyll!\n");
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

 You can also add line numbers using `linenos`, such as:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

### Including Images and resources

Chance are, at some points, you'll want to include images, downloads, or other digital assets along with your text content. There are a number of ways to include digital assets in Jekyll, one common solution is to create a folder in the root of the project directory call something like `assets`, into which any images, files or  other resources are placed.

Including an image assets in a post:

```shell
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/screenshot.jpg)
```

or:

```shell
![My helpful screenshot]({{ "/assets/screenshot.jpg" | absolute_url }})
```

linking to a PDF for readers to download:

```shell
[get the PDF]({{ site.url }}/assets/mydoc.pdf)
```

see at the official guide,[Writing Post](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).

## Add HTTPS

When you want to add HTTPS, it is really a big work, see [this guide](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/22667528), that is helpful. The tool we use is [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

There is an auto tool can help you add https, [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/), which helps you set your site here, and make it faster, more importantly, it is free, ***highly recommend***.
